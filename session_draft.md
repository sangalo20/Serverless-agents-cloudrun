Title: Maximizing Cloud Run for Lightweight Production-Ready Agentic Applications

Session Abstract: 
Autonomous agents don’t need always-on infrastructure, they need flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. In this session, we will explore how Google Cloud Run enables production-ready agentic applications by running agent services on-demand, scaling seamlessly from zero, and keeping costs low.

You will learn how to package agent logic into lightweight containers and offload heavy inference to Vertex AI models, Gemini API, or GPU-enabled services, while keeping orchestration on Cloud Run. We will cover best practices such as managing short-term memory with Memorystore, long-term memory with Firestore or AlloyDB, and using Eventarc, Pub/Sub, and IAM for secure, event-driven workflows.

By the end, you will see how Cloud Run’s serverless container model makes it possible to deploy lightweight, scalable, and production-ready autonomous agents that react in real time.
